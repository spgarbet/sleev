## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to
## enable compilation with C++11 (where available)
##
## Also, OpenMP support in Armadillo prefers C++11 support. However, for wider
## availability of the package we do not yet enforce this here.  It is however
## recommended for client packages to set it.
##
## And with R 3.4.0, and RcppArmadillo 0.7.960.*, we turn C++11 on as OpenMP
## support within Armadillo prefers / requires it
#CXX_STD = CXX11

## Setting the correct compiler for Macs
#CC = clang
#CXX = clang++


## Remove openMP flags from Mac build, which does not support them
#SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS=
#SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS=


## Allowing larger memory allocations to arrays in Rcpp Armadillo
## Remove stupid warnings from Rcpp Eigen (warning: pragma diagnostic pop could not pop, no matching push [-Wunknown-pragmas]    #pragma clang diagnostic pop)

## Compilation
